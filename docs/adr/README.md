# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Pinecone MCP Helper project. ADRs are used to document significant architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## What is an Architecture Decision Record?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. It provides a record of architectural decisions that were made, why they were made, and what alternatives were considered.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title that summarizes the decision
2. **Status**: The current status of the decision (Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Context**: The problem and context that led to the decision
4. **Decision**: The decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: The consequences of the decision, both positive and negative
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered and why they were not chosen

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the `template.md` file
2. Name the new file using the format `NNNN-short-title.md` where `NNNN` is the next number in sequence
3. Fill in the template with the details of your architectural decision
4. Submit the ADR for review and discussion
5. Update the status as appropriate

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: The ADR is proposed and under discussion
2. **Accepted**: The ADR has been accepted and the decision is being implemented
3. **Rejected**: The ADR has been rejected and will not be implemented
4. **Deprecated**: The ADR was accepted but is no longer relevant
5. **Superseded**: The ADR was accepted but has been superseded by another ADR
