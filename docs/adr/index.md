# Architecture Decision Records

This section contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Pinecone MCP Helper project. ADRs are used to document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## Available ADRs

{% assign adrs = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.path contains 'adr/' and page.name != 'index.md'" | sort: "name" %}
{% for adr in adrs %}
- [{{ adr.title | default: adr.name | replace: ".md", "" | replace: "-", " " | capitalize }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ adr.url }})
{% endfor %}

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs are a lightweight way to document the key decisions that impact the architecture of a system.

Each ADR includes:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title that summarizes the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The forces at play, including technological, business, and team constraints
4. **Decision**: The response to these forces, clearly stating the direction taken
5. **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision, including trade-offs and impacts
6. **References**: Any relevant supporting information or external resources
