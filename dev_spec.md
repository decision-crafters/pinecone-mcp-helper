Okay, here is a comprehensive, developer-ready specification for the Python script based on our step-by-step discussion.

## Developer Specification: Git Repo to Pinecone Ingestion Pipeline

**1. Introduction**

This document specifies a Python script designed to automate the process of ingesting content from a Git repository and associated web links into a Pinecone vector database. The script will clone a specified repository, process its content using Repomix, identify external links, scrape/search those links using Firecrawl, embed all collected text content into vectors, and finally upsert these vectors into a structured Pinecone index.

**2. Architecture**

The script will follow a sequential pipeline architecture, executing the following major steps:

1.  **Initialization & Input:** Receive the Git repository URL and load configuration.
2.  **Repository Management:** Clone or update the target repository.
3.  **Repomix Processing:** Run Repomix on the local repository and capture its output.
4.  **Repomix Output Parsing & Chunking:** Read, parse, and chunk the Repomix output.
5.  **Embedding Preparation:** Configure the embedding model based on settings.
6.  **Pinecone Index Management:** Ensure the target Pinecone index exists (create if necessary).
7.  **Repomix Data Embedding & Ingestion:** Embed Repomix chunks and upsert to Pinecone.
8.  **Firecrawl URL Identification:** Extract URLs from the Repomix output.
9.  **Firecrawl Processing:** Use Firecrawl SDK to scrape/search extracted URLs.
10. **Firecrawl Data Embedding & Ingestion:** Chunk and embed Firecrawl results and upsert to the same Pinecone index.
11. **Completion/Reporting:** Indicate success or failure.

The script will primarily interact with the local filesystem (for Git and Repomix output) and external APIs (Pinecone, Embedding Service, Firecrawl).

**3. Requirements**

**3.1. Command Line Interface (CLI):**

* The script must accept one required positional command-line argument: the Git repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo.git`) or a local path to a Git repository.

**3.2. Configuration:**

* The script must read configuration parameters from a YAML file named `config.yaml` located in the same directory as the script.
* `config.yaml` must include:
    * `pinecone.dimension`: Integer specifying the vector dimension for the Pinecone index.
    * `pinecone.metric`: String specifying the similarity metric for the Pinecone index (e.g., `cosine`, `dotproduct`, `euclidean`).
    * `embedding.model`: String specifying the identifier or name of the embedding model to use.
* Sensitive credentials and environment-specific details must be read from environment variables:
    * `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Pinecone API key.
    * `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: Pinecone environment name.
    * `EMBEDDING_API_KEY`: API key for the embedding service (required only if the chosen `embedding.model` is API-based).
    * `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: Firecrawl API key.

**3.3. Git Repository Handling:**

* The script must clone the specified repository into a subdirectory within the script's current working directory. The subdirectory name should be derived from the repository name (e.g., `my-repo` from `https://github.com/user/my-repo.git`).
* If a directory with the same name already exists and is a valid Git repository, the script must perform a `git pull` within that directory to update it.
* If the directory exists but is *not* a Git repository, the script should handle this error (see Error Handling).

**3.4. Repomix Execution and Output Processing:**

* The script must execute the `repomix` command (assuming it's available in the system's PATH) within the cloned repository's directory.
* The script must capture the output generated by `repomix`, expecting a file named `repomix-output.xml` by default.
* The script must parse the `repomix-output.xml` file.
* The script must identify and extract content chunks based on the `<file>` tags within the XML structure. Each `<file>...</file>` block represents a chunk.

**3.5. Embedding:**

* The script must implement a mechanism to generate vector embeddings for text content using the model specified in `config.yaml`.
* If the embedding model requires an API key, the script must use the `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication.
* The script must ensure the embedding process generates vectors with a dimension matching `pinecone.dimension` from `config.yaml`.

**3.6. Pinecone Index Management and Data Ingestion:**

* The script must connect to Pinecone using the API key and environment from environment variables.
* The script must determine the target index name based on the Git repository name.
* The script must check if an index with the target name already exists.
    * If it exists, the script should proceed to upsert data into it.
    * If it does not exist, the script must create a new index with that name, using the dimension and metric specified in `config.yaml`.
* The script must embed the chunks derived from the `repomix-output.xml` using the configured embedding method.
* The script must upsert the resulting vectors into the target Pinecone index.
* All vectors derived from the original repository content must be placed into the single namespace `repo-name-code` within the index.
* Each upserted vector from repository content must include metadata:
    * `text`: The original text content of the chunk.
    * `source_type`: Set to `repository`.
    * `file_path`: The original file path from the repository (as indicated in the Repomix output).

**3.7. Firecrawl Integration:**

* After processing Repomix output, the script must re-read the `repomix-output.xml` file.
* The script must extract URLs from the text content within `repomix-output.xml` by searching for patterns starting with `http://` or `https://`.
* The script must use the Firecrawl Python SDK to interact with the Firecrawl API.
* The Firecrawl API key will be read from the `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` environment variable. The script should use the SDK's default API endpoint (implicitly tied to the API key).
* For each extracted URL, the script should perform either a scrape or search action using the Firecrawl SDK. The choice between scrape and search is left to the developer based on typical use cases for links in documentation/code (scraping is likely more common to get content).

**3.8. Firecrawl Data Processing and Ingestion:**

* The text content obtained from Firecrawl (scrape results) must be processed for ingestion.
* If the content from a single Firecrawl result exceeds 500 characters, the script must split it into chunks of 500 characters.
* Each chunk of Firecrawl content must be embedded using the *same* embedding method configured for the repository content.
* The resulting vectors from Firecrawl content must be upserted into the *same* Pinecone index and the *same* namespace (`repo-name-code`) as the repository content.
* Each upserted vector from Firecrawl content must include metadata:
    * `text`: The original text content of the chunk.
    * `source_type`: Set to `firecrawl`.
    * `source_url`: The URL from which the content was scraped/searched.

**4. Data Handling Details**

* **Repomix Chunking:** Based on the XML structure (`<file>...</file>`). Each chunk preserves the file path and content.
* **Firecrawl Chunking:** If content > 500 characters, split into fixed-size chunks of 500 characters. Overlap is not explicitly required by the user but can be added during development if deemed beneficial for embedding quality.
* **Embedding:** A consistent embedding method (configured via `config.yaml` and `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` if needed) must be applied to all text chunks (both Repomix and Firecrawl).
* **Metadata:** Essential metadata (`text`, `source_type`, `file_path`/`source_url`) must be associated with each vector during upserting for traceability and potential filtering.
* **Pinecone Namespacing:** All vectors (from repository and Firecrawl content) will reside in the single namespace `repo-name-code`.

**5. Error Handling Strategies**

The script must implement robust error handling for various stages of the pipeline:

* **CLI Argument Parsing:** Handle missing or invalid repository URL arguments.
* **Configuration Loading:** Handle missing `config.yaml` file or missing/invalid keys within the file.
* **Environment Variables:** Check for the presence of required environment variables (`PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` if applicable) and raise informative errors if missing.
* **Git Operations:** Handle errors during `git clone` or `git pull` (e.g., invalid URL, network issues, authentication failures).
* **Repomix Execution:** Handle cases where the `repomix` command is not found or fails to execute correctly.
* **Repomix Output Reading/Parsing:** Handle missing `repomix-output.xml` or errors during XML parsing.
* **Embedding:** Handle errors during the embedding process (e.g., API errors, invalid input).
* **Pinecone API Calls:** Handle errors during Pinecone index creation, upserting, or connection issues. Implement retry logic for transient Pinecone API errors.
* **Firecrawl API Calls:** Handle errors during Firecrawl scrape or search operations (e.g., invalid URL, API limits, network issues). Implement retry logic if appropriate.
* **File System Operations:** Handle potential issues with directory creation, writing, or reading files.

**Error Reporting:**

* The script should use Python's logging module to log the progress and errors.
* Critical errors should ideally stop the script's execution and report a clear error message to the user via standard error.
* Non-critical errors (e.g., failure to scrape a single URL) might be logged as warnings, allowing the script to continue processing other data.

**6. Testing Plan**

A comprehensive testing strategy should be employed:

* **Unit Tests:**
    * Test individual functions/modules:
        * CLI argument parsing.
        * Configuration loading from `config.yaml`.
        * Environment variable reading and validation.
        * Repomix XML parsing and chunking logic.
        * URL extraction from text content.
        * Firecrawl content chunking logic.
        * Metadata generation.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Test interactions with external services (using mock objects or test environments where appropriate):
        * Git command execution (mock `subprocess` calls).
        * Pinecone API interactions (mock Pinecone client calls for create_index, upsert).
        * Embedding service API interactions (mock embedding function/API calls).
        * Firecrawl API interactions (mock Firecrawl SDK calls for scrape/search).
* **End-to-End Tests:**
    * Test the entire pipeline workflow with a small, controlled test repository and mock/test environments for external services.
    * Verify that the correct data is processed, embedded, and upserted into the mock Pinecone index with appropriate metadata and namespace.
    * Test error paths (e.g., invalid repo URL, missing environment variable, service API failure).

**7. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for this Spec)**

* Adding support for `context7` integration.
* Adding support for different output formats for Repomix or different input sources for Firecrawl.
* Implementing more sophisticated chunking strategies (e.g., semantic chunking).
* Adding options for deleting existing data in the Pinecone index before upserting.
* Parallelizing embedding or upserting processes.
* Adding detailed progress reporting to the user.
